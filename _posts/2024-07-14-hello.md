## Hello (First Post)

Greetings, and welcome to my new little blog! My name is Nick and this is a place in which I wish to share my thoughts and musings on things generally related to computing and technology as well as progress and how-to's on any personal projects I am working on.

It's been a curious journey going from my old career (teaching) to a new one (programming? sysadmin? helpdesk? Only time will tell where I end up in the next few months). I hope my writings here are interesting for you, if not helpful## First Post
